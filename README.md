# Darklight | Raider

### ⚠️ Risks

#### Termination
- If the discord bot is created under your account, you could face action if your bot is reported.
- To combat this, create the bot on an alt account.

## Skidding
This is an open source project, So I can't do anything to prevent skidding, I'm just going to say skidding won't help you in coding and will just make you worse if you're all based on copying other people's code, take this as an opportunity on learning how to create a bot or your own nuker, you may use this as reference for your future discord bots.

##How to run
- You must have [python](https://python.org) installed and must check the add to path option in the setup executable, once done open up your terminal, before running the code you must install it's dependencies by running this.
```
pip install discord
```
After this is done you can run the python file.
```
cd Downloads
```
Let's say the python file is in your downloads so you have to type that, but if it was a custom folder or path you would copy it like this

and type it in like this:
```
cd C:\Users\vynve\OneDrive\Desktop\dog
```
Once this is done, you would run it by doing this

```
python Darklight-Raider.py
```
or if this doesn't work then
```
python Darklight-Raider.py
```
